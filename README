NAME
    Text::FileTree - convert a list of files with full paths to a tree

DESCRIPTION
    A file list can be organized in a number of ways. The two that most
    probably comes to mind is a "state free" way, where each file is listed
    with full path and doesn't depend on its context. The "find" command
    outputs files in this way.

    There is also the "stateful" way of display file lists, where each file
    is sorted by its common parents. E.g., instead of

     foo/bar
     foo/baz

    you might have the following structure instead:

     foo/
       bar
       baz

    This module does just that, converts a "plain" file listing in to the
    "stateful", directory sorted, way.

AVAILABILITY AND BUG REPORTING
    Latest released version is available through CPAN. Latest development
    version is available on github:

    *   <http://metacpan.org/pod/Text::FileTree>

    *   <http://github.com/olof/Text-FileTree>

    Bugs can be reported on either rt.cpan.org, as an issue on github or as
    an e-mail to me. The primary issue tracker is github.

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This module does not separate between a file and a directory. This only
    affects leaf nodes, as you can deduce that a file with children is
    indeed a directory. This is unlikely to be fixed, as there is really no
    way of distinguish them in, say, the output from find. Often, you should
    be able to determine this by context: e.g. by giving "find" the "-type
    f" flag --- now all leaf nodes are regular files.
